# CSS-Examples
Repository to store css examples

## Introduction
The examples include a base archetype to build upon, incorporating a widely used *bundler* with pre-configured settings in order to simplify the development. In this case **Parcel.js** was chosen due to its ease of configuration, specially for the type of project expected in the examples (static websites with HTML and CSS).
